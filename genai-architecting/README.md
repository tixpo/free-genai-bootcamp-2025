## Problem Statment
A school in Middle East wants to teach Arabic to their students by leveraging Gene AI. They want an efficient and economical solution.

## Requirements 

### Business Requirements
The first requirement is to deliver a quality product, in our case Arabic Learning Solution powered by GenAI. The quality will then be translated into marketing for other schools. 
The second requirement is to build an economical solution in order to generate a desired profit.

### Functional Requirements
The solution should transcribe from English to Arabic for the students by answering their queries, in a progressive manner. The solution is designed to not to provide the exact answer in the first go, rather allowing the students to internalize the concepts and put them into practice.
It also be able to generate practice sentences for transcribtion with increasing difficulty.

### Non-Functional Requirements
The solution should be able to handle the traffic of 300 students. It should also be able to adapt to higher number of students if a large influx is expected.
The solution interface/design should be convinient and intuitive following best UI/UX principles.

### Tooling 
The solution should leverage Generative AI tools such as Large Language Models, Image Geneartion and more with the following iterations of solution development.

## Risk 
The major risk is exploitaion of the students data privacy, as the system will have the background of info of the studnets and key insights about their personalities.

## Assumptions
The open source LLMs will be able to do the job. This is done to cut the cost of the development.
The second assumption is that there would be datasets available to finetune the LLM to complete tasks of learning Arabic.

## Constraints 
The budget is limited as the school is a private school as a result they donot have handsome funds from the government. We will have to be very critical about our spend.
