    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

    - GOOD: Concise output.

    | Arabic | Meaning |
    | سَجَدَ      | He prostrated |
    | غُرْفَةٌ     | Room |
    | مَرْيَمُ     | Maryam	|
    | صَالِحٌ     | Righteous |

    We have two clauses: "Maryam prostrated in the garden" and "She is a pious daughter".
    Let's deal with the first clause. Then we will deal with the second clause.

    Considerations:
    - Its a Jumla Fi'liyyah, so first identify the fi'l.
    - Then find the outside doer if any.
    - Then construct the sentence.
    
    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    [Clause 1: Maryam prostrated in the garden]
    [Fi'l] [Fai'l] [Maf'ool]

    </assistant:output>
     <user:input>
        سَجَدَتْ مَريَمَ على غٌْرفَتِها
    </user:input>
    <assistant:output>
        You are close! 
        What status does the doer has?
        على means "on" but we need "in".
        Try building the sentence again.

<example>
    <user:input>
        She forgives her son in the house.
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it provides the femine version of the fi'l instead of masculine one.
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it provides the pronouns and harfs as well.
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table the last harakah is -ٍ which should have been rafah as it shouldn't have given the answer in the table.
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Fi'l] [Fai'l] [Muta'liq bil Fi'l]?
    - BAD: Unnecessary instructions regarding the next steps.
    - BAD: The second response of the assistant gives the solution of the mistakes. 
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break this sentence into two parts and build it step by step.

    | Arabic | Meaning |
    | تَغْفِرُ | She forgives |
    | ها   | her |
    | ابن | son |
    | في  | in |
    | بَيْتٍ | house |

    Sentence structure:
    [Fi'l] [Maf'ool] ها [Muta'liq bil Fi'l (في)]

    Considerations:
    - Make sure to use the femine version.
    - The house should be in Jar version.
    - Make sure to use the proper version of the house (بيت).

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
    </assistant:output>
     <user:input>
        يَغْفِرُ إبْنِها في بيتٍ
    </user:input>
    <assistant:output>
        You have the following mistakes:
        The Fi'l should be تغفِرُ instead of يَغْفِرُ.
        The إبن should have ـَ harakah.
        There should be البيت instead of بيت.
