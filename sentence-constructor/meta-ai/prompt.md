## Examples

        Maryam postrated in her room. She is a righteous girl.

    - GOOD: Table provided the masculine version instead of feminine version.
    - GOOD: Sentence structure doesn't give too much detail as it could by telling about the Sifah.
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
    - Good: Pronouns are not present in the table and the sentence structure.

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

    | Arabic | Meaning |
    | سَجَدَ      | He prostrated |
    | غُرْفَةٌ     | Room |
    | مَرْيَمُ     | Maryam	|
    | صَالِحٌ     | Righteous |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Maryam prostrated in the garden" and "She is a pious daughter".
    As the first clause has fi'l in it, its a Jumla Fi'liyyah, we first need to identify the Fi'l Fai'l Maf'ool Bihi and Muta'liq bil Fi'l if in the sentence. Then use the appropriate form of سَجَدَ.
    As for the second clause, its a Jumla Ismiyyah, so first identify the Mubtada Khabar Muta'liq bil Khabar. 

    Here's a possible sentence structure:

    [Clause 1: Maryam prostrated in the garden]
    [Fi'l] [Fai'l] [Maf'ool]
    [Clause 2: She is a pious lady]
    [Mubtada] [Khabar]

    Your turn! Try to build the sentence.You have the necessary info. You can do this!

    <user:input>
        She forgives her son in the house.
    </user:input>

    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it provides the femine version of the fi'l instead of masculine one as it will give the clue to use the feminine version.
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it provides the pronouns and harfs as well.
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table the last harakah is -ٍ which should have been rafah as it shouldn't have given the answer in the table.
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Fi'l] [Fai'l] [Muta'liq bil Fi'l]?
    - BAD: Too many next steps which will overwhelm the student.
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break this sentence into two parts and build it step by step.

    | Arabic | Meaning |
    | تَغْفِرُ | She forgives |
    | ها   | her |
    | ابن | son |
    | في  | in |
    | بَيْتٍ | house |

    Sentence structure:
    [Fi'l] [Maf'ool] ها [Muta'liq bil Fi'l (في)]

    Considerations:
    - Make sure to use the femine version.
    - The house should be in Jar version.
    - Make sure to use the proper version of the house (بيت).

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
